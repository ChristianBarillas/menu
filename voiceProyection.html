        <p class="english-class">
            Greetings! Thank you for returning to my blog. :D
            Before I begin this post, I want to acknowledge that it's been a few weeks since my last entry and many things have happened in class since then. So, let me update you on our recent topic, which is about our voice and its various elements, including imitation, resonance, breathing, articulation, and tone.
            
            Imitation is the first aspect we've explored. As a man, my voice tends to be deeper than women's due to biological factors and hormones. However, I can modify my voice to sound more like a woman's through imitation, which can be easier for some and harder for others. Conversely, a woman can imitate a man's voice by speaking in a lower pitch. I believe it's easier for women to imitate a man's voice than for men to imitate a woman's voice.
            
            We can also imitate children by speaking softly or not enunciating words properly. This seems to be the simplest way.
            
            In class, we worked in groups and did exercises where we imitated each other's voices.
          <br /><br />


Resonance.
This can be defined as the characteristic of a sound that is deep, rich, and echoes. During class, we practiced an exercise that involved elongating vowel sounds for a prolonged period of time. I must admit, this exercise was quite challenging. Mr. Orlando was exceptional at it, and I found myself admiring his skill.  He sounded almost like an opera singer.

Breathing.
Breathing is crucial for all living beings. Personally, I tend to feel anxious when speaking in front of large crowds, and I've read about different breathing techniques to control my heart rate and calm my nerves. Nevertheless, it's still difficult for me. In class, I learned the importance of taking deep breaths while speaking and moving.

In one exercise, we had to engage in a conversation with someone while standing at a distance, moving forward or backward, or even jumping in the same place. It was a fun activity that helped us practice keeping the conversation going while simultaneously focusing on our breathing.

<br /><br />


Articulation.
The way we articulate our words while speaking can have a significant impact on how effectively and clearly our message is conveyed. It's also important to articulate well when learning a new language and adapting to different accents.

In one class exercise, we put a pen in our mouths and attempted to have a conversation with a partner. Surprisingly, it was quite amusing because it was challenging to understand one another, and some of us resorted to mumbling or faking it. Nonetheless, it was a fun way to highlight the significance of clear articulation.





<br /><br />

Tone.
Varying your tone of voice depending on the message you are delivering is essential. Using a flat tone can make a conversation seem dull and uninteresting. In class, we learned that different tones can be used depending on the intention behind the message.

For instance, there's an institutional tone, which tends to be more serious. If you are a professor, it's essential to convey that you are a trustworthy and serious person. There's also a commercial tone that's used when selling a product or service, and it needs to be convincing. Finally, there's the neutral or natural tone, which is typically used in everyday conversations.

Nidia, who is a radio host, is excellent at varying her tone of voice. She shared examples of the commercials she has made, and her delivery was incredibly professional. I wouldn't have been able to tell it was her voice if she didn't tell us. I believe it would be beneficial to receive training on regulating our voice in different scenarios, such as during presentations or simultaneous interpretation, as this is when most errors can occur.


<br><br>

Overall, the recent voice projection classes have been incredibly enjoyable. We've had the opportunity to showcase our talents in imitation, pantomime, and creativity both as individuals and in groups.

Admittedly, Mr. Orlando shared some strange examples with us, such as a woman who was exceptionally skilled at imitating animal and environmental sounds. The song was called Chuncho, and it was quite impressive.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to sharing my next entry with you!
