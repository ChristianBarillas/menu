      Greetings once again after the midterm break! This week, we have an exciting topic that focuses on "Depicting Educators". These are the individuals who bestow upon us their extensive knowledge and make us who we are today.
      When describing our teachers, it's essential to consider both their academic and non-academic performance. Here are a few aspects to contemplate when describing teachers:
      
      The teacher's conduct in the classroom
      In this regard, teachers can be classified into five categories: Controllers, Prompters, Participants, Resources, and Tutors. They may take the lead from the front, assist students who need guidance, participate actively in discussions, provide resources for better understanding, and offer feedback, respectively.
      
      The teacher as a coordinator
      A teacher's job is to prepare and plan their lessons in a way that students can comprehend better. They conduct thorough research to ensure that they have a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The phases of instruction include engagement, demonstration, initiation, and organizing feedback.
      
      The teacher as a performer
      Teachers can be compared to actors/actresses since their demeanor varies depending on the activity or lesson they are presenting.
      



      <br><br>

     

  Relationship-Building
The relationship between teachers and students, also known as rapport, can either be positive or negative. To foster a positive rapport, teachers should listen to students, use their names, respect them, and treat them equally.

The teacher as a mode of instruction
Teachers use various tools such as expressions, body language, and pronunciation to convey meaning and instruction. These elements are crucial for learners to take into account while learning from them.

Native vs. Non-Native Teachers
There is a common misconception that only native-speaker teachers can teach a language well because of their fluency and knowledge. However, non-native teachers have a unique perspective and understanding of how students think, making them just as effective. Both are great at what they do and have a passion for teaching.

We should always appreciate and respect all the teachers in the worldðŸŒŽ because they have a significant impact on who we are today. Their efforts, whether inside or outside the classroom, leave a positive impression on our lives. Thank you so muchðŸ’œ!


<br><br>

During our session, we also discussed the different roles that teachers play in the classroom. Sometimes, teachers take on the role of a Controller, maintaining discipline and order in the classroom by enforcing rules and procedures. They monitor student behavior to ensure a safe and productive learning environment. At other times, teachers act as Prompters, providing cues and guidance to encourage student participation and engagement in the learning process. They may ask questions, provide advice, and guide students to finding their own solutions and answers. Teachers can also assume the role of a Participant, actively engaging with students in the learning process by participating in class discussions, working alongside students, and providing feedback on their work. Additionally, teachers can act as a Resource, providing students with access to knowledge, information, and learning materials. They may recommend resources such as books and websites, and provide guidance on how to use them effectively. Finally, teachers may take on the role of a Tutor, providing one-on-one support and guidance to students who require additional help or individual attention. They may work with students who are struggling with a particular concept or subject, or provide additional challenges to students who require more advanced material.


<br><br>

It's great to see that you have a deep appreciation for your teachers, even if you might not always show it through your facial expressions. Remember that teachers play a critical role in shaping our lives and helping us achieve our goals, so it's important to always show them the respect they deserve. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and notes with me, and I look forward to reading your future entries!
