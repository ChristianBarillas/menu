     Hello guy! in the class we're learning about this wonderful topic and let me ask you something have you ever heard of multiple intelligences? It's an exciting idea that says there isn't just one type of intelligence, but many. Each one of us has different and special skills that make us smart in different ways.

      For example, some people are really good with words and languages. They might love reading books, telling stories, or learning new languages. This is called linguistic intelligence.
      
      Others are great at solving problems and figuring out puzzles. They might love math or science, and enjoy experimenting and discovering new things. This is called logical-mathematical intelligence.
      
      Some people have a talent for art and design. They might love to draw, paint, or create things with their hands. This is called spatial intelligence.
      
      Others are fantastic at sports and physical activities. They might love to dance, play soccer, or climb trees. This is called bodily-kinesthetic intelligence.
      
      Some people are really good at music. They might love to sing, play an instrument, or compose their own songs. This is called musical intelligence.
      
      There are also people who are great at understanding and connecting with other people. They might be good listeners, great friends, or natural leaders. This is called interpersonal intelligence.
      
      Some people are really good at understanding their own feelings and thoughts. They might be good at reflecting on their experiences, setting goals, and making plans. This is called intrapersonal intelligence.
      
      Finally, there are people who are great at understanding and appreciating the natural world. They might love animals, plants, or rocks, and enjoy exploring and observing the world around them. This is called naturalistic intelligence.
   

      <br><br>

      <br>1.Linguistic intelligence: the ability to use language effectively, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening.
      <br>2.Logical-mathematical intelligence: the ability to reason, problem-solve, and think abstractly.
      <br>3.Spatial intelligence: the ability to think in three dimensions, visualize objects, and mentally manipulate them.
      <br> 4.Bodily-kinesthetic intelligence: the ability to control and coordinate physical movement and handle objects skillfully.
      <br> 5.Musical intelligence: the ability to recognize, create, and appreciate music and musical patterns.
      <br> 6.Interpersonal intelligence: the ability to understand and relate to other people, including recognizing their motivations and emotions.
      <br> 7.Intrapersonal intelligence: the ability to understand one's own thoughts, feelings, and motivations.
      <br>8.Naturalistic intelligence: the ability to observe and appreciate nature, including recognizing and categorizing plants, animals, and natural phenomena.

      <br><br>

      Here are some pictures about my homework to know what kind of emotional intelligence I have more developed
