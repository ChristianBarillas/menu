        <p class="english-class">
          Greetings, esteemed teacher and classmates!

          I'm delighted to be here once again, sharing another entry with all of you.
          
          Today, let's delve into the world of speaking. Communication is ubiquitous, and speaking plays a vital role in it. As students, it is crucial for us to acquire this productive skill in the most effective manner possible.
          
          In our classes, we engage in lively discussions, thought-provoking debates, and freely express our opinions on a wide range of topics. We continuously practice speaking, and this aspect holds tremendous significance for us, as future educators or individuals well-versed in the subject. Practice is key. Similar to writing, speaking can take on an academic tone, such as delivering speeches, or it can be more informal and everyday, facilitating our communicative abilities.
          
          <br />  <br />
          In the classroom, it is imperative that we take into account the individual needs of our students. After all, we communicate because we have needs. By understanding our students' levels of proficiency, their interests, and even their age, we can better tailor our teaching methods to promote active engagement and practice. This brings to mind an intriguing exercise we recently observed in a video: the "Information Gap." This exercise involves one student possessing certain pieces of information while another student holds the remaining details. Through asking and answering questions, they bridge the information gap and effectively communicate with one another.
          
          To further enhance our speaking skills, there are a plethora of creative activities at our disposal. Tongue twisters provide an entertaining way to challenge our pronunciation abilities, while singing along to our favorite songs allows us to immerse ourselves in spoken language. Roleplays offer an opportunity to step into different roles and express ourselves in various scenarios, while playing pronunciation-based bingo encourages us to focus on specific sounds. All of these activities foster a rich speaking practice. During our virtual sessions, we were introduced to the concept of Task-based learning, where teachers start from scratch by brainstorming ideas, such as social problems, to ignite discussions and tap into our prior knowledge. As the teacher presents the task, our minds are brimming with countless ideas. Now, I can appreciate the behind-the-scenes efforts that my English teacher put into those lessons.
          
          Furthermore, we explored Jazz Chants by Carolyn Graham, a professor at NYU and a jazz singer. Inspired by her observations of conversations on the bustling streets of New York at 5:00 PM, Graham devised Jazz Chants. These rhythmic conversations aid us in memorizing useful phrases through catchy rhythms, while simultaneously honing our pronunciation skills. Jazz Chants are concise, practical, repetitive, and easily graspable. In fact, we even had the opportunity to create our very own Jazz Chant:
          
  
          
          Let us continue our journey of exploring creative ways to elevate our speaking abilities. Thank you all for your attention and active participation.
          <br />  <br />
