            Hey there!

            It's wonderful to have you back once again! :3

            <br /><br />

            
            This entry serves as a continuation of the previous one, but why, you ask? Well, it's because the topics were split across two or three classes (I believe :O). In my previous entry, I discussed some exercises related to modeling and facial expressions. Today, I'll delve into activities centered around "Body Language & Coordination" and also touch upon "Improvisation."
            
            So, let's dive in! :)

            <br /><br />

            
            Maintaining Focus
            The initial exercise involved maintaining eye contact with a classmate while resisting the urge to burst into laughter. It's intriguing because as teachers, it's crucial to remain focused even if the students are exhibiting diverse facial expressions.
            
            The second activity required walking around the classroom while maintaining eye contact with a classmate, regardless of accidental collisions with others.
            <br /><br />

            Conveying Emotions through Facial Expressions and Body Language
            The third activity revolved around attempting to make classmates laugh. How? By altering facial expressions or engaging in miming, with the objective of eliciting laughter.
            <br /><br />

            This is where modeling comes into play. One of the tasks involved walking like a model while changing facial expressions. Additionally, we were encouraged to compliment each other. :3
            
            Improvisation (My personal favorite so far! :3)
            At this point, we were tasked with envisioning a scene from a movie. Truth be told, my group and I initially believed we had to reenact THAT scene in class. Consequently, we opted for a scene from "Shrek" as we thought it would be "easier to recreate." However, as it turned out, we had to hand over THAT scene to another group and WE had to "recreate" the scene THAT group selected. Hilariously enough, they had also chosen a scene from "Shrek." The class was divided into four groups, each exchanging scenes. We had a blast observing other groups bring their assigned scenes to life.
            <br /><br />

          
            Personally, I adored the Improvisation exercise as it's an excellent activity, particularly for introverts like myself. This exercise truly helped boost our self-confidence.
            <br /><br />


            I immensely enjoyed these classes, and it's quite evident which activity resonated with me the most! :3
